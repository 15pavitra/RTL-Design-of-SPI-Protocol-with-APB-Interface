# RTL-Design-of-SPI-Protocol-with-APB-Interface
Here is a **short, crisp, technical brief** — perfect for GitHub or resume:  ---  A Verilog-based RTL design of an SPI Master Controller with APB interface, implementing core blocks such as status/control registers, baud-rate generation, data-path logic, and an APB-driven FSM for register access. The design integrates MOSI transmission logic.
